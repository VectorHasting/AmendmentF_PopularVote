That the following article is proposed as an amendment to the 
Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to all intents and 
purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of 
three-fourths of the several States: 
“ARTICLE ___
Section 1:
All elected High Office Holders of the Federal Executive Branch 
shall be elected by national popular vote.
Section 2:
The Governors of each state shall certify and sign and seal and then 
transmit to the seat of government of the United States, directed to the 
President of the Senate, a complete list of every candidate who stood for 
election in that state to each Office of the Federal Executive Branch, and 
the total number of votes cast in that state for each candidate for each 
Office.
The Mayor or highest elected official of the District constituting the 
seat of Government of the United States shall transmit in such manner as 
the Congress shall direct a complete list of every candidate who stood 
for election to each Office of the Federal Executive Branch, and the total 
number of votes cast in the District for each candidate for each Office.
The President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and 
House of Representatives, no earlier than thirty days and no later than 
sixty days after the election, open all the certificates and the votes shall 
then be counted.
The person having the greatest number of votes for each Office shall 
be the Office-Holder Elect unless a two thirds majority of the House of 
Representatives, and a two thirds majority of the Senate, with a quorum 
being present, vote at that time to declare the person receiving the 
greatest number of votes constitutionally ineligible to hold that Office, in 
which case the person with the next most votes shall be considered to 
have had the greatest number of votes for that Office.
In the case where more than one candidate has the same number of 
votes as the greatest number of votes for any Office, then the President 
of the Senate will use a method of chance such as coin toss to decide 
which candidate shall be considered to have the greatest number of votes 
for that Office.”
